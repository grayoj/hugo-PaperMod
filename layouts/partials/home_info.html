            Iâ€™m Gerald Maduabuchi Ogbonnaya Okereke, a passionate computer programmer and
            consultant with a penchant for orchestrating the digital world. I am
            heavily invested in working on cool projects within the scope of
            distributed systems, machine learning and software engineering in general. I enjoy teaching and working on a
            lot of hobby projects. My journey has led me to collaborate with
            esteemed organizations such as <u><a href="https://phillipsconsulting.net">Phillips Consulting</a></u> and
            <u><a href="https://www.legend.ng/">Legend Nigeria</a></u>
            to name a few, to execute several projects. I've also taught the
            engineering teams of huge government parastatals such as
            <u><a href="https://www.pencom.gov.ng/">Nigerian Pension Commission</a></u> and the
            <u><a href="https://www.nysc.gov.ng/">National Youth Service Corps</a></u>, helping them migrate or scale
            their infrastructure.
